## Features

- **Interactive buttons**: Users can either continue "majuk" or choose "tak dah" to stop.
- **Growing button effect**: If "majuk lagi" is clicked multiple times, the button grows and eventually switches to the "tak majuk" option.
- **Surprise Ending**: Clicking the final option redirects the user to a pre-filled WhatsApp message.
